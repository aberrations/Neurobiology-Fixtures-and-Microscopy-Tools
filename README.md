# Systems-Biology-Toolbox

"Mechanical" includes devices to facilitate two-photon and light-sheet micrscopy of both in-vivo specimens and ex-vivo cleared tissues, devices to faciltate behavioral experiments on mice, a modified version of the mini-scope camera to record neural dynamics in awake freely moving mice from the Aharoni lab at UCLA, and a new set of electrophysiology sample holders for microscope rigs.

"Software" includes ImageJ Macro and Python Scripts to automate video processing for the mini-scope camera produced images, and a variety of softwares to control flicker and sound stimulation systems.

The goal of these projects is to simplify systems biology research. Any use is governed by the MIT License, which can be read in this repository. For questions, feel free to comment here or reach out to me at my email address. I hope this is able to help with your various research projects!

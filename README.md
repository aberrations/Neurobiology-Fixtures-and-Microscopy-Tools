# Systems Biology Toolbox

Simple devices and software to facilitate microscopy, electrophysiology, and microbiology techniques for systems biology research. Easy to fabricate and use with low-cost 3D Printers.

"Mechanical" includes devices to facilitate two-photon and light-sheet micrscopy of both in-vivo specimens and ex-vivo cleared tissues, devices to faciltate behavioral experiments on mice, a modified version of the mini-scope camera to record neural dynamics in awake freely moving mice from the Aharoni lab at UCLA, and a new set of tissue sample holders for electrophysiology rigs.

"Software" includes ImageJ Macro and Python Scripts to automate video processing for the mini-scope camera produced images, and a variety of softwares to control flicker and sound stimulation systems.

The goal of these projects is to simplify systems biology research. All use is covered by the MIT License, which can be read in this repository.

Included in this folder are modules for the RFID Stand that can be found in the RFID_Stand folder.

The RFID Reader Lock, comically dubbed "canis superbus" on local files due to its shape's resemblence to a dog, is a small part
that can be snapped onto the RFID_Stand_Upper above the RFID Reader to loosely secure itand prevent it from falling
from the cradle due to the potential weight imbalance caused by an attached USB wire (depending upon its length).
A new version of the RFID Reader Lock may be designed to tightly secure the RFID Reader as to stop it from moving entirely.

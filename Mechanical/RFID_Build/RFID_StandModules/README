Included in this folder are modules for the RFID Stand that can be found in the RFID_Stand folder.

The RFID Reader Holder is a small part that can be snapped onto the RFID_Stand_Upper above the RFID Reader to loosely secure it
and prevent it from falling from the cradle due to the potential weight imbalance caused by an attached USB wire (depending upon its length).
A new version of the RFID Reader Holder may be designed to tightly secure the RFID Reader as to stop it from moving entirely.
